      "hero_h1": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "hero_p": "<em>Find answers and tips to make the most of CronPost.</em>",
      "question_01": "What is CronPost?",
      "answer_01": "<p>CronPost is a digital contingency planning service, designed to help you send important messages and deliver love to your relatives, even when you can't be present. It is a secure network that allows you to schedule messages (via email or in-app messages) to be sent automatically, ensuring your messages always reach the right person at the right time, in any situation.</p><p>CronPost offers two main functions to meet different user needs:</p><h3>1. Ultimate Cron Messenger (UCM) - The Digital \"Dead Man's Switch\"</h3><p>This is the core feature, acting as a \"dead man's switch\" for your digital life. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>You set up a \"check-in\" schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly) to confirm to the system that you are still safe and active.</li><li>If you miss this check-in after reminders, the system will automatically activate and send out the important messages (called Initial Message - IM and Follow-up Messages - FMs) that you have prepared in advance.</li></ul><p>This is the ideal solution to:</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your digital legacy:</strong> Ensure access information for digital assets like bank accounts, e-wallets, and important documents is sent securely to your loved ones.</li><li><strong>Send a final message:</strong> Convey your thoughts, feelings, and instructions to family and friends, ensuring your voice is still heard.</li><li><strong>Ensure personal safety:</strong> Activate automatic alerts for those working in high-risk environments such as journalists, soldiers, and aid workers.</li></ul><h3>2. Simple Cron Messenger (SCM) - Direct Timed-Message Sending</h3><p>This is a simple and direct tool for when you just want to send a message at a specific future time without a complex check-in mechanism. SCM is perfect for:</p><ul><li>Sending birthday and anniversary greetings on the exact day, even if you plan years in advance.</li><li>Setting reminders for yourself or others about important events.</li><li>Sending scheduled announcements conveniently and accurately.</li></ul><p>In summary, CronPost is more than just a timed messaging tool. It is a dedicated assistant and a protective shield, helping you prepare for life's uncertainties and ensuring your most important messages are always delivered.</p>",
      "question_02": "What sending methods does CronPost support?",
      "answer_02": "<p>CronPost offers you three flexible messaging methods; you can choose the one that best suits your needs for each message you create:</p><ul><li><strong>CronPost Email (Default):</strong> This is the simplest and fastest way to get started. Your message will be sent from our official email address (<code>noreply@cronpost.com</code>). You don't need to perform any technical setup—just compose your message and schedule it.</li><li><strong>In-App Messaging:</strong> Send a secure and direct message to another CronPost user right on our platform. This is a great option for secure communication, as the recipient must also have a CronPost account to view the message. Premium users can send attachments as secure links to Free users.</li><li><strong>User Email (via your own SMTP):</strong> This advanced option allows you to send emails directly from your personal email address, helping recipients recognize you immediately. To do this, you need to perform a one-time setup by providing CronPost with the SMTP information from your email provider.</li></ul><p>Information you will need:</p><ul><li>SMTP Server (e.g., <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>)</li><li>Port (e.g., 587 or 465)</li><li>Email and App Password</li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Important Note:</strong> For security reasons, most major email providers (like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo) require you to create a separate <strong>App Password</strong> to use with third-party services like CronPost, instead of using your main login password.</p><p>How to find the information and create an App Password: You can refer to the official guides from popular providers or search on Google/ask an AI with the syntax <em>\"SMTP settings [Your email provider's name]\"</em> and <em>\"Create App Password [Your email provider's name]\"</em>.</p>",
      "question_03": "How does SCM work?",
      "answer_03": "<p><strong>Simple Cron Messenger (SCM)</strong> is the tool that allows you to send a message at a specific future time without the UCM's \"check-in\" mechanism. It is the perfect choice for sending birthday wishes, event reminders, or any other announcements you want to schedule in advance.</p><p>Scheduling an SCM message is very simple. After composing the content, you will have two main scheduling options:</p><h3>1. Schedule a One-Time Send (Unloop SCM)</h3><p>This option is used to send your message <strong>only once</strong> at a precise date and time in the future.</p><p><strong>How to set up:</strong></p><ul><li>On the scheduling screen, select the <strong>\"One-time Schedule\"</strong> option.</li><li>Use the displayed calendar and clock to select the exact <strong>date and time</strong> you want the message to be sent.</li><li>Press <strong>\"Start SCM\"</strong>, and your message will be queued to be sent at the specified time.</li></ul><h3>2. Schedule a Recurring Send (Loop SCM)</h3><p>This option allows you to send the same message <strong>multiple times</strong> according to a cycle you define.</p><p><strong>How to set up:</strong></p><ul><li>Select the <strong>\"Loop Schedule\"</strong> option.</li><li>Choose the <strong>\"Loop Type\"</strong> you want, including:<ul><li><strong>By minutes:</strong> Send repeatedly after a certain number of minutes.</li><li><strong>By days:</strong> Send repeatedly after a certain number of days at a specific time.</li><li><strong>Day of the week:</strong> Send on a fixed day of the week (e.g., 9:00 AM every Monday).</li><li><strong>Date of the month:</strong> Send on a fixed date each month (e.g., the 15th of every month).</li><li><strong>Date of the year:</strong> Send on a fixed date each year (e.g., December 25th every year).</li></ul></li><li>Fill in the corresponding parameters for your chosen loop type (e.g., number of minutes, days, or sending time).</li><li>Finally, in the <strong>\"Repeat\"</strong> section, enter the total number of times you want the message to be sent.</li><li>Once you are satisfied with the setup, just press <strong>\"Start SCM\"</strong>, and the system will automatically manage the sending for you according to the set schedule.</li></ul>",
      "question_04": "How does UCM work?",
      "answer_04": "<p><strong>Ultimate Cron Messenger (UCM)</strong> is the heart of CronPost. You can think of it as an automated guardian that operates based on your account's status. Understanding these statuses will help you master the service completely.</p><p>The UCM lifecycle revolves around these 4 main statuses:</p><h3>1. INS (Inactive Status)</h3><p>This is the initial and \"resting\" state of your account. In this state, the UCM system is not activated, no countdown is running, and no messages are scheduled to be sent. The system is waiting for you to set up a schedule (by creating and activating an IM) to begin.</p><h3>2. ANS (Active Status)</h3><p>When you have activated a schedule, the account switches to this state. This is the \"normal\" and safe state, which consists of two alternating phases:</p><ul><li><strong>CLC (Check-in Loop Countdown):</strong> This is the \"safe\" period and makes up the majority of the active cycle. A clock will count down to the time you need to check-in. During this phase, the system defaults to considering you as safely checked-in.</li><li><strong>WCT (Waiting Check-in Time):</strong> When the CLC timer ends, the Waiting Check-in Time (WCT) window opens. This is a limited period (set by you, e.g., 6 hours) during which you <strong>must</strong> perform the \"check-in\" action to inform the system you are still safe. If you do not check-in before this window closes, the next state will be triggered.</li></ul><h3>3. FNS (Frozen and Send Status)</h3><p>This is the most critical backup state, automatically triggered when you fail to check-in within the WCT window. When in the FNS state:</p><ul><li><strong>The account is frozen:</strong> You cannot change any settings, messages, or schedules to ensure the integrity of the plan.</li><li><strong>The system begins sending messages:</strong> Your scheduled messages will start being sent in the predefined order.</li><li><strong>A special action is required to stop:</strong> To exit this state, you need to use a special link sent to your email or take action from within your account.</li></ul><p>Understanding this <strong>INS → ANS (CLC and WCT) → FNS</strong> cycle will give you peace of mind that your important messages will always be sent exactly when you need them most.</p>",
      "question_05": "What is an IM and how does it work?",
      "answer_05": "<p>The <strong>Initial Message (IM)</strong> is the first and most important message in the Ultimate Cron Messenger (UCM) process. You can think of it as the \"cornerstone\" of your contingency plan.</p><p>The main roles of an IM are:</p><ul><li><strong>Activate UCM:</strong> Creating and scheduling an IM will switch your account from inactive (INS) to active (ANS), starting the safety monitoring cycle.</li><li><strong>Define the Check-in Schedule:</strong> The schedule you set for the IM determines your \"check-in\" cycle, including both the Countdown Loop (CLC) and the Waiting Check-in Time (WCT).</li><li><strong>Be the First Message Sent:</strong> If the emergency FNS state is triggered (because you didn't check-in), the IM will be the first message automatically sent by the system to your recipient.</li></ul><h3>How to Schedule an IM?</h3><p>You have two main scheduling options for an IM, depending on whether you need continuous monitoring or just for a specific future event.</p><h4>1. Recurring Schedule (Loop Check-in)</h4><p>This option is suitable when you want a continuously repeating check-in cycle for safety monitoring. You can choose the following loop types:</p><ul><li><strong>Daily:</strong> The system will require you to check-in at a fixed time every day.</li><li><strong>By a Specific Number of Days:</strong> Check-in repeats after a certain period, such as every 3 days.</li><li><strong>By Day of the Week:</strong> Check-in on a fixed day of the week (e.g., 9:00 AM every Monday).</li><li><strong>By Date of the Month:</strong> Check-in on a fixed date each month (e.g., the 15th of every month).</li><li><strong>By Date of the Year:</strong> Check-in on a fixed date each year (e.g., December 25th every year).</li></ul><h4>2. One-Time Schedule (Unloop Check-in)</h4><p>This option is used when you only want UCM to monitor for a single, specific time in the future. You will choose a precise date and time for the message to be sent if you do not check-in.</p><p class=\"note\"><strong>Critical Warning for One-Time Schedules:</strong> If you set your Initial Message (IM) to use a \"One-time Schedule\", please be aware that <strong>any check-in action will permanently cancel this schedule</strong>. You will need to set it up again. To avoid accidental cancellation, consider disabling the \"Automatic on Sign-in\" feature if you use this type of schedule.</p>",
      "question_06": "What is an FM and how does it work?",
      "answer_06": "<p>A <strong>Follow-up Message (FM)</strong> is an additional message sent <strong>after</strong> your Initial Message (IM), in the event your account enters the FNS (Frozen and Send) emergency state.</p><p>You can create multiple FMs to send a sequence of information over time. For example, your IM could be a general notification, then an FM is sent 3 days later to provide detailed instructions, and another FM is sent the following week with additional information.</p><p class=\"note\"><strong>Important Note:</strong> You must create and schedule an Initial Message (IM) <strong>before</strong> you can create a Follow-up Message (FM).</p><h3>How to Schedule an FM?</h3><p>The key difference when scheduling an FM is that its timing is always calculated <strong>relative to the start of the FNS state</strong> (i.e., when the IM is sent). You have the following flexible scheduling options:</p><ul><li><strong>Number of days after IM is sent:</strong> Send the FM a specific number of days after FNS begins. For example, if you set it to \"3 days\", the message will be sent on the 3rd day of the FNS process.<ul><li><strong>Special note for the value \"0 days\":</strong></li><li>If you set the value to <strong>\"0 days\"</strong>, the FM will be scheduled to be sent on the <strong>same day</strong> that FNS begins.</li><li>However, the sending will only occur if the time you set for the FM (e.g., 15:00) is <strong>later than</strong> the actual time the IM was sent on that day (e.g., 10:00).</li><li>In the opposite case (e.g., you set the FM to be sent at 18:00, but FNS only starts at 19:00), that FM message will be considered undeliverable and will be moved to the <strong>\"cancelled\"</strong> state.</li><li>You cannot set a repeat for an FM scheduled for \"0 days\" after the IM.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A day of the week:</strong> Send the FM on the next specific day of the week. For example, if FNS starts on a Thursday, you can schedule a message to be sent the following \"Monday\".</li><li><strong>A date of the month:</strong> Send the FM on a specific day of the next month. For example, send on the \"15th\" of the month after FNS starts.</li><li><strong>A date of the year:</strong> Send the FM on a specific day and month annually. For example, send on \"December 25th\" every year after FNS starts.</li><li><strong>A specific date (Non-recurring):</strong> Send the FM once on a specific future date, month, and year, as long as that time is after the IM has been sent.</li></ul>",
      "question_07": "How can I perform a Check-in?",
      "answer_07": "<p>Checking in is the core action to reset the UCM countdown and prevent the emergency sending process (FNS). When your account is in the <strong>WCT (Waiting Check-in Time)</strong> state, you can do this in the following ways:</p><h3>1. Manual Check-in Button on the Website:</h3><p>This is the main and most direct method. A large <strong>\"CHECK-IN\"</strong> button will be activated and prominently displayed in two places:</p><ul><li>On your <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Ultimate Cron Messenger (UCM)</strong> page. You just need to press this button to complete the check-in.</li></ul><h3>2. Automatic on Sign-in (Optional):</h3><p>This is a convenient feature that you can enable on the <strong>Profile & Settings</strong> page (user-profile.html).</p><ul><li><strong>How it works:</strong> If enabled, simply logging into your account during the WCT period will automatically be recorded as a check-in.</li><li><strong>Note on PIN code:</strong> If you also enable the \"Require PIN for all critical actions\" option, a window will pop up after you log in, asking you to enter your PIN to confirm this check-in action. If you do not enter the PIN, the check-in will not be counted.</li></ul><h3>3. Check-in Link via Email (Optional):</h3><p>For maximum convenience, you can enable the \"Add a one-click check-in link...\" option in the <strong>Check-in Options</strong> section of your profile.</p><ul><li><strong>How it works:</strong> When this feature is enabled, the WCT reminder emails that the system sends you will contain a special, secure link.</li><li>You just need to click this link to perform the check-in immediately <strong>without needing to log in or enter a PIN</strong>.</li><li><strong>Important note: </strong>For security reasons, each check-in token included in reminder emails is only valid until a new reminder email (with a new check-in token) is sent. The maximum validity period of any check-in token is until the end of the current WCT cycle.</li><li><strong>Security Note:</strong> Because this method bypasses the usual authentication steps, it offers high convenience but reduces a layer of security. Please consider carefully before enabling this feature.</li></ul><h3>4. Additional Check-in Reminder (Premium Feature):</h3><p>This is a special feature for <strong>Premium</strong> users to enhance peace of mind.</p><ul><li><strong>How it works:</strong> In addition to the default reminder emails, you can set up one <strong>final</strong> additional reminder to be sent to your email.</li><li><strong>Customization:</strong> You can customize when this reminder is sent by setting a specific number of minutes before your WCT window closes, giving you one last chance to check-in and mitigate potential risks.</li></ul>",
      "question_08": "What are some tips and suggestions for setting up a suitable UCM?",
      "answer_08": "<p>To set up an effective and reliable UCM plan, you should consider the special cases for schedules and apply some suggestions for appropriate frequency.</p><h3>a. Important Notes on Scheduling</h3><p>Our system is designed to handle special time cases intelligently, but you need to know how it works:</p><ul><li><strong>\"One-time\" Schedule for IM:</strong> This is the most important note. If you set your Initial Message (IM) to a \"one-time\" schedule (e.g., to be sent on 01/01/2026), any <strong>check-in</strong> action you take before that time <strong>will permanently cancel this schedule</strong>. To avoid unintentional cancellation, you should consider disabling the \"Automatically check-in on login\" option.</li><li><strong>Non-existent dates in a month:</strong> If you set a recurring schedule for the 31st of every month, the system will automatically skip sending in months that do not have a 31st day (like February, April, June...). Your check-in cycle will continue and wait for the next valid month (e.g., May).</li><li><strong>February 29th:</strong> Similarly, if your schedule falls on February 29th, the system will skip it in non-leap years and continue its normal cycle.</li><li><strong>FM set to \"0 days after IM\":</strong> This message will be sent on the same day FNS begins, but only if its scheduled sending time is later than the actual time the IM was sent. If FNS starts at 7:00 PM, an FM scheduled for 6:00 PM will be canceled because its valid sending time has passed.</li><li><strong>FM with a one-time (Unloop) schedule:</strong> This schedule will only be executed if its sending time is <strong>after</strong> FNS has started. If your FNS starts after the date you set for the FM, that message will be skipped.</li></ul><h3>b. Suggestions for an Effective UCM Setup</h3><ul><li><strong>Start with IM, then FMs:</strong> Always set up and schedule your Initial Message (IM) first. This will activate the check-in cycle. Only then should you create your Follow-up Messages (FMs).</li><li><strong>Choose a suitable CLC (Check-in Loop) frequency:</strong><ul><li>Unless you have a special purpose (like being in a high-risk area), you <strong>should not</strong> set the check-in frequency too short (e.g., daily). This can be annoying and easily lead to missed check-ins due to being busy.</li><li>An ideal frequency is to choose a special day <strong>annually</strong> (e.g., your birthday, New Year's Day). This turns checking in into a meaningful, memorable, and low-pressure habit.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Set a reasonable WCT (Waiting Check-in Time):</strong><ul><li><strong>Don't set it too short:</strong> A very short WCT (e.g., 1-2 hours) can be easily missed if you are in a meeting or experience a temporary issue (lost phone, no internet).</li><li><strong>Don't set it too long:</strong> A very long WCT (e.g., several days) might lead to complacency, where you read the reminder email and then forget about it.</li><li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> A period of <strong>24 to 72 hours</strong> is usually most suitable. It's long enough for you to handle temporary issues but short enough to act on right after receiving the reminder email.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Don't forget important anniversaries:</strong> Take advantage of the <strong>\"Date of the year\"</strong> scheduling feature for FMs to prepare loving messages for special occasions like your children's birthdays or your wedding anniversary. This way, even if FNS is activated, the system will remember and automatically send these messages to your loved ones on that special day each year. It's a wonderful way to ensure your care is always present, creating meaningful \"hugs that transcend time.\"</li><li><strong>Use the \"Trust Verifier Email\":</strong> This is a very important layer of protection. Add the email of a trusted person (spouse, best friend...). If FNS is activated, they will also receive a notification email and can help you stop the process if it's a false alarm.</li></ul>",
      "question_09": "How to stop an activated FNS (Frozen and Send) process?",
      "answer_09": "<p>When your account enters the FNS state, you still have full control to stop it. CronPost provides two main methods for you to do this, ensuring safety even if you cannot log in to your account.</p><h3>1. Stop FNS via Email Link (Token Method)</h3><p>This is the most flexible method, designed for emergencies when you may not have access to your CronPost account.</p><ul><li><strong>How it works:</strong> As soon as FNS begins, the system automatically sends an email containing a unique, secure termination link to your email address. If you have set up a <strong>\"Trust Verifier Email\"</strong>, that person will also receive a similar email.</li><li><strong>Process:</strong><ol><li>Open the email and click the FNS termination link.</li><li>You will be redirected to a special confirmation page. This page <strong>does not require a login or PIN</strong>.</li><li>Press the <strong>[Confirm FNS Termination]</strong> button to complete the process.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Important time limit:</strong> For security reasons, the FNS Termination Link sent to your email is only valid for <strong>72 hours</strong> after the FNS process begins.</li></ul><h3>2. Stop FNS directly from the UCM Page (In-app)</h3><p>If you can still log in to your CronPost account, this is the most direct and secure way, especially after the email link has expired.</p><ul><li><strong>How it works:</strong> When the account is in the FNS state, the Ultimate Cron Messenger (UCM) page will display a special interface.</li><li><strong>Process:</strong><ol><li>Log in to your CronPost account.</li><li>Go to the UCM page (or click the <strong>[STOP FNS]</strong> button on the Dashboard).</li><li>On this page, you will see a large <strong>[TERMINATE]</strong> button.</li><li>Click this button. If you have a PIN set, the system will ask you to enter it to authenticate the action, which is an important security step.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Benefit:</strong> This method allows you to stop FNS at any time as long as you can log in, without being limited by the 72-hour validity of the token.</li></ul><p>After you confirm the FNS termination using one of these two methods, all unsent messages (IM and FMs) will be canceled, and your account will return to the <strong>INS (Inactive)</strong> state, ready for you to set up again if you wish.</p>",
      "question_10": "Why is the PIN important?",
      "answer_10": "<p>Imagine the <strong>PIN Code</strong> as a \"second layer of security\" for your account. While your main password protects access to the account, the PIN is designed to protect the <strong>most critical actions inside</strong> the account, ensuring that only you can make core changes to your contingency plan.</p><p>We strongly recommend all users set up a PIN for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Protects critical actions:</strong> Once you have created a PIN, most critical actions such as changing the UCM schedule, editing/deleting messages, and even checking in (if you enable the option) will require you to re-enter the PIN for confirmation. This prevents unintentional changes if someone gains access to your logged-in session.</li><li><strong>Automatic account locking:</strong> To defend against PIN guessing attacks, the system will automatically <strong>temporarily lock</strong> your account after a number of consecutive incorrect PIN entries. The lock time will increase with further incorrect attempts, helping to protect your account.</li><li><strong>Unique recovery code:</strong> When you create your PIN for the first time, the system will provide you with a unique <strong>Recovery Code</strong>. This is the <strong>only way</strong> you can reset your PIN if you happen to forget it.</li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Tip:</strong> Please copy and store this Recovery Code in a very safe place, separate from your CronPost account (e.g., in a password manager or written down and kept in a safe).</p><p>In summary, setting up a PIN adds a solid layer of security, ensuring that the important plans and messages you have carefully prepared are not accidentally or intentionally altered or deleted.</p>",
      "question_11": "What are the message-related limits to be aware of?",
      "answer_11": "<p>To ensure the system operates stably and fairly for all users, CronPost has some limits on messages, which differ between Free and Premium accounts. Here are the main limits you need to be aware of:</p><h3>1. Message Length Limit</h3><p>Each message you compose (including UCM and SCM) has a maximum character limit in the content section:</p><ul><li><strong>Free Account:</strong> 5,000 characters/message.</li><li><strong>Premium Account:</strong> 50,000 characters/message.</li></ul><h3>2. Stored Messages Limit</h3><p>This is the total number of messages (including UCM, SCM, and unscheduled drafts) that you are allowed to store in your account at one time.</p><ul><li><strong>Free Account:</strong> 100 messages.</li><li><strong>Premium Account:</strong> 10,000 messages.</li></ul><h3>3. Active Messages Limit</h3><p>This is a more critical limit that only counts messages with a <strong>pending and valid schedule</strong>. Messages that are in draft form or have completed sending are not counted toward this limit.</p><ul><li><strong>Free Account:</strong> 10 active messages.</li><li><strong>Premium Account:</strong> 1,000 active messages.</li></ul><p><strong>How recurring active messages are counted:</strong> A special point to note is how the system counts this limit for recurring messages. A message set to repeat will consume a number of slots in the \"Active Messages\" limit corresponding to its <strong>remaining number of repetitions</strong>.</p><p class=\"note\"><strong>Example:</strong> If you create an FM and set it to repeat 5 times, it will occupy 5 slots in your active message limit. After the message is sent for the first time, it will only occupy 4 slots, and so on until it is completed.</p><h3>4. In-App Messaging Storage Time Limit</h3><p>To ensure system performance, messages in the <strong>In-App Messaging (IAM)</strong> feature will be automatically cleaned up after a certain period. This limit does <strong>not</strong> apply to your UCM and SCM messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Free Account:</strong> Messages are stored for <strong>60 days</strong>.</li><li><strong>Premium Account:</strong> Messages are stored for <strong>360 days</strong>.</li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> In a conversation between a Free and a Premium user, the longer storage time of 360 days will be applied.</p>",
      "question_12": "How can I be sure that my messages will be sent as configured?",
      "answer_12": "<p>We understand that reliability is the most crucial element of our service. CronPost ensures the delivery of your messages through three main mechanisms: <strong>visual monitoring</strong>, <strong>automatic retries</strong>, and <strong>careful user guidance</strong>.</p><h3>1. Real-Time Visual Monitoring</h3><p>You can always see exactly what the system is doing:</p><ul><li><strong>Countdown Timers:</strong> Both the <strong>UCM</strong> and <strong>SCM</strong> pages have continuously running countdown timers, showing the exact time remaining until the next action (the next check-in or the message sending time). This helps you always stay aware of the status of your schedules.</li><li><strong>Sending History Page:</strong> This is where you can check and verify every message that has been sent. This page records details of each send, including:<ul><li>Which message was sent.</li><li>Who the recipient was.</li><li>The exact time of sending.</li><li>The final status: Success, Failed, or Partially successful.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>2. Automatic Retry Mechanism</h3><p>Sometimes, sending an email can encounter temporary issues (e.g., the recipient's server is down). To handle this, CronPost has a smart automatic retry mechanism:</p><ul><li>If a message (SCM or FM) cannot be sent on the first attempt, the system will not give up immediately. Instead, it will automatically <strong>try to resend that message up to 3 times</strong> with increasing intervals between each attempt.</li><li>Only after all 3 attempts have failed will the message be marked as \"Failed\" in the Sending History.</li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Special Note for Initial Messages (IM):</strong> Due to its urgent nature and as the initiating message, the <strong>IM will only be sent once and does not have an automatic retry mechanism</strong>. However, even if sending the IM fails (e.g., due to an incorrect recipient email address), the FNS process <strong>will still continue</strong>. The Follow-up Messages (FMs) in your sending flow will still be processed and sent according to their set schedule.</p><h3>3. Important Tips to Ensure Successful Sending</h3><p>To help the system operate as accurately as possible, please note the following points:</p><ul><li><strong>Check Your Timezone:</strong> All schedules you set will operate based on the timezone you have configured in your <strong>CronPost Profile</strong>, not the timezone on your computer or phone. Please ensure you have selected the correct timezone.</li><li><strong>Check Recipient Addresses:</strong> A small typo in an email address can cause the sending to fail. Always double-check the recipient's address before saving the message.</li><li><strong>Note on Attachment Size:</strong><ul><li>When using the <strong>CronPost Email</strong> method (for Premium accounts), you can attach files with a total size of <strong>less than 49 MB</strong>.</li><li>If you use your <strong>own SMTP</strong> (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), you will be limited by the provider's size limit, which is typically around <strong>25 MB</strong>. Please check your email provider's limit to ensure attachments are not too large.</li></ul></li></ul>",
      "question_13": "What is a Quote and how does it work?",
      "answer_13": "<p>The <strong>Quote</strong> feature allows you to automatically insert randomly selected, pre-saved quotes into your messages. This helps make your messages more lively and meaningful. You can use quote collections created by CronPost or create and share your own.</p><h3>How to Use</h3><h4>1. Manage Quote Collections (Folders)</h4><p>First, you need to access the <strong>Quote Management</strong> page from the navigation bar. Here, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a New Folder:</strong> Each folder represents a theme (e.g., 'love-quotes', 'life-philosophy.en'). You can set a description and choose to share it publicly (is_public) for others to use.</li><li><strong>Add Content:</strong> Inside each folder, you can add many different quotes. Each account can create a maximum of <strong>1000</strong> quotes.</li><li><strong>Discover & Add:</strong> You can search for and \"add\" public folders shared by other users to your collection.</li></ul><h4>2. Insert a Quote into a Message</h4><p>When composing a message (UCM, SCM, or IAM), there are two ways to insert a quote:</p><ul><li><strong>Use the Insert Quote Button:</strong> On the editor's toolbar, click the paper icon ('Insert Quote') at the end of the toolbar. A \"Quote Picker\" window will appear, allowing you to select a folder from the list (system, yours, or subscribed). The system will automatically insert the corresponding placeholder at the cursor's position.</li><li><strong>Manual Insertion:</strong> You can type the placeholder directly into the title or body of the message using the following structure: <code>{{quote:'author','folder_key'}}</code>.<ul><li><strong>author:</strong> The creator of the folder. Use 'CronPost' for system folders, or your email for folders you create.</li><li><strong>folder_key:</strong> The identifier of the folder you want to use.</li></ul></li></ul><p class=\"note\"><strong>Important Notes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Randomness:</strong> The system will select <strong>one random</strong> quote from the folder you specify to insert into the message at the time of sending.</li><li><strong>Limits:</strong> Each account (regardless of Free or Premium) can only create a maximum of 50 Quote Folders and 1,000 Quote Contents.</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong><ul><li>If you insert two identical placeholders (in other words, from the same quote folder) in the same message, both will be replaced by the <strong>same randomly selected quote</strong>.</li><li>If a message is sent to multiple recipients, they will all receive the version of the message with the <strong>same quote</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sharing Quote Folders:</strong> You can share folders you create with everyone by setting them to Public. Therefore, be careful not to include sensitive or important information in public Quote Folders.</li><li><strong>Using Public Quote Folders:</strong> You can use Public Quote Folders from other users, but be aware that the content of that Public Quote Folder is decided by its owner. Therefore, to ensure the safety of your message content, we encourage you to only use Quote Folders from CronPost, those you create yourself, or from a source you truly trust.</li></ul>",
